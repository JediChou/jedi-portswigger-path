    "# SQL injection UNION attacks\n",
    "\n",
    "When an application is vulnerable to SQL injection, and the results of the query are returned within the application's responses, you can use the `UNION` keyword to retrieve data from other tables within the database. This is commonly known as a SQL injection UNION attack.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `UNION` keyword enables you to execute one or more additional `SELECT` queries and append the results to the original query. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT a, b FROM table1 UNION SELECT c, d FROM table2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This SQL query returns a single result set with two columns, containing values from columns `a` and `b` in table1 and columns `c` and `d` in table2."
