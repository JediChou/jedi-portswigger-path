    "\n",
    "You can detect SQL injection manually using a systematic set of tests against every entry point in the application. To do this, you would typically submit:\n",

    "* The single quote character ' and look for errors or other anomalies.\n",
    "* Some SQL-specific syntax that evaluates to the base (original) value of the entry point, and to a different value, and look for systematic differences in the application responses.\n",
    "* Boolean conditions such as`OR 1=1` and`OR 1=2`, and look for differences in the application's responses.\n",
    "* Payloads designed to trigger time delays when executed within a SQL query, and look for differences in the time taken to respond.\n",
    "OAST payloads designed to trigger an out-of-band network interaction when executed within a SQL query, and monitor any resulting interactions."
