    "For complete beginners, we recommend starting with our server-side topics. These vulnerabilities are typically easier to learn because you only need to understand what's happening on the server. Our materials and labs will help you develop some of the core knowledge and skills that you will rely on time after time."

    "SQL injection is an old-but-gold vulnerability responsible for many high-profile data breaches. Although relatively simple to learn, it can potentially be used for some high-severity exploits. This makes it an ideal first topic for beginners, and essential knowledge even for more experienced users."

For this reason, it's important to learn how to identify and exploit authentication vulnerabilities, and how to bypass common protection measures."
