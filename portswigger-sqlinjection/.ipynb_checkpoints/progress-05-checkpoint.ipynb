    "```url\n",

    "```\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Crucially, note that `--` is a comment indicator in SQL. This means that the rest of the query is interpreted as a comment, effectively removing it. In this example, this means the query no longer includes `AND released = 1`. As a result, all products are displayed, including those that are not yet released.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The modified query returns all items where either the `category` is `Gifts`, or `1` is equal to `1`. As `1=1` is always true, the query returns all items."

    "Take care when injecting the condition `OR 1=1` into a SQL query. Even if it appears to be harmless in the context you're injecting into, it's common for applications to use data from a single request in multiple different queries. If your condition reaches an `UPDATE` or `DELETE` statement, for example, it can result in an accidental loss of data."
